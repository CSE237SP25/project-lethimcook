1. A user should be able to set a spending limit (`SpendingLimit` branch)  
2. A user should be able to freeze their account (`FreezeAccount` branch)

### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
- Finalize and integrate all features into `main`  
- Improve menu navigation and user interface clarity  
- Refactor `BankApp.java` to remove the large main method and improve code structure  
- Add more comprehensive testing and ensure all features are stable

### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
- The `MoneyReceiver` class needs review; its purpose overlaps with `Transfer` logic

### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line?

Weâ€™ve added a `run.sh` script to simplify compiling and running the project on macOS/Linux.

#### How to Run (macOS/Linux):

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project folder
2. Make the script executable (only once):

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
